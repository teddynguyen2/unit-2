# Title: **Population of Large US Cities from 2010-2019**

## Author: Theodore Nguyen

# Description: 
The map indicates fifteen large cities scattered throughout the US using spatiotemporal markers in a red-orange color. A user may investigate each of these cities by individually clicking on the cities, which will reveal a popup displaying the city, state, and population during a specific year. The data is prepopulated to reveal 2010 initially; however, the user may use the slider tool found on the bottom left side of the screen to navigate through the years from 2010 to 2019. On the left-hand side, a color coded map legend may assist the user in identifying and differentiating map features such as water, forest, land, ice, city, and border.
